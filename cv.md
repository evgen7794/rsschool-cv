## About Me ##
After graduating from university with a degree in law, I decided to discover something new. I have been programming for about 8 months. I chose the direction of frontend development. Having received the initial knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS, I began to actively learn React. 
I try to constantly develop my programming skills, although this is very difficult for me.


## Skils ## 

* HTML, CSS 
* JS, React
* Figma

## Code example ##
_____ 
*Kata (8kyu) 'Rock Paper Scissors!' in Codewars*: Let's play! You have to return which player won! In case of a draw return Draw!. 

``` 
const rps = (p1, p2) => {
  if (p1 === p2){
    return 'Draw!'
  }
  if (p1 === 'scissors' && p2 === 'paper' 
      || p1 === 'rock' && p2 === 'scissors' 
      || p1 === 'paper' && p2 === 'rock'){
    return 'Player 1 won!'
  } else {
    return 'Player 2 won!'
  }
};
```
